      "description": "2013 UPDATE!: I finally revisited this track! You can find the new version of this song on the Original official soundtrack i made for the Xbox360 game Castlestorm! follow the link:http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=...-----Made in 2007!Made in FL5.This track has a long history of development. it started out as a small victory fanfare for a game called mecha pumble, but i liked the clip so much after finishing it that i decided to try to make something more of it. the original song is about twice in length,  but pulled out / just has more of the same. later when the contest for castlecrashers songs came up, i cleaned it up into a loop and submitted it, i figured it would go well for something of an intro. i placed 4th, if i recall correctly.later this song was used in a few flash games, like for instance, age of war.Now a final remake is in production, but until then, enjoy this, almost classic tune by now ;)go here for higher quality ver. and download. don't forget to vote if you download it!: http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/liste...\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594Facebook     \u25b8 https://www.facebook.com/Waterflamewo...WF Official    \u25b8 http://www.waterflamemusic.com/Newgrounds \u25b8 http://www.waterflame.newgrounds.com/Twitter     \u25b8 https://www.twitter.com/WaterflameMusicDeviant     \u25b8 https://waterflame89.deviantart.com/Google+     \u25b8 https://plus.google.com/+Waterflamemu...Bandcamp    \u25b8 http://www.waterflame.bandcamp.com/SoundCloud  \u25b8 https://soundcloud.com/waterflame89Spotify     \u25b8https://open.spotify.com/artist/7biIl...\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594\u2594",
